1,"The worsr airline ive ever flewn with. No screens, even in long haul. Extremely tight seats. Uncomfortable as hell. And the worst is the cairo airport and the baggage handling. Baggage got lost on the way in, one week delay and a meager 100$ refund, which obviously didnt even make up for half of the equipment which had to be bought to not run around without clothing for one week. But even that only just after a hell of a discussion with the local representative. And the worst: my bag got damaged on the way back. Still in process for a refund which is intentionally made extremely difficult with no answers for weeks and then outragous requirements like sending all documents in original via post, eventhoug all documents have been send electronically a few times... Never give those guys one cent."
2,"Please get my luggage to me - I'm here for COP27 and it's being over 4days now, this airline left my luggage and can't tell me where it is or was left at. This is worst airline I have ever travelled through and will highly discourage anyone to book this useless airline. Can't attend my conference as planned because of your careless service."
3,"I was really surprised about quality of service on boadr anfter reading many bad rewiews. Flight London-Cairo-Johannesburg. Both boards were new Dreamliners clean, new,  with a lot of space for legs. Selection of music and movies was huge and good. Food on both flight was delicious,  probably the best I had on board. Staff was helpful,  flights started at time"
4,"Worst airline ever to use.Hostesses are sullen and cannot speak English although the customers were predominantly English speaking. Hostesses were disinterested in their Business Class customers.Food was inedible and cold in any case. Only lousy fruit juice to drink. No alcoholic drinks served. Toilet floors were filthy dirty.I shudder to think of the type of food and service that would be dished out to Economy Class customers.Entertainment movies were pathetic and negligible choice for English speakers.Although, Business Class bed is excellent quality.Business Class transit lounge is pathetic quality.I will never fly Egypt Air again."
5,The worst service experience I had!I had 4 flights with them and they were all delayed. Most of the staff were rude. The flight attendant ignored me when I asked for water multiple times. The flight coordinator actually threatened me. It took me 3 hours to check in even though there were less than 10 people in front of me and they had 4 open windows. After all the hustle they put me through they lost my luggage. When it was found after 8 days the luggage and most of its contents were damaged. When I informed the customer service all of these they didn't care at all. I would rather walk 8000 miles than fly with them. I don't even know how they are in business treating customers like this.
6,"Not impressed. On the homeward flight from Luxor we were delayed. No greeting or explanation from the captain. More importantly NO safety checks on take off from the crew. They were rude,clumsy and off hand and didn't smile or make you feel welcome.After they served the meal they sat on their phones at the back of the plane reluctant to come if called. We had two other flights during our trip with Egypt Air and they were only marginally better but at least they did the seat belt etc checks."
7,"lost my 2 luggage, they refused to pay for compensation or interim expenses even though their staff admitted it , never respond to emails, stay away. Toronto Office never respond and Cairo office ignore the emails."
8,"Very bad staff, and the treatment is very rude. I do not recommend traveling on EgyptAir Airlines until after a radical change from them.The reservation system on the site is stupid and has errors and the employees refuse to fix the EgyptAir error and when you talk to them, they tell you that the error is your fault, the worst company in recovering money and canceling the reservation, there is no technical supportThe employees are not qualified to work for a company the size of EgyptAir, but rather harm it and the reputation of a company with that heritage, unfortunately"
9,"Forget your Refund Once they have your money,  it will never be refunded. Been 4 months since I canceled my fully refundable tickets.Went through all Egypt Air procedures Never received anything,  yes a lot of Email replies saying Thank You for Choosing Egypt Air. Never again"
10,"Why are black people still flying with racist airline? I am so disgusted that these racist  Egyptian people are allowed to fly into black countries. Egyptian airline , and the entire people in Egypt are racist against black people. i am asking  black people not fly with this airline. we are treated like we are  in slavery with this airline. We as black people can not allow this to go any longer ."
11,It clearly mentions on their webpage a charge of 50 Usd for extra 10 kg. But as you arrive they charge you 105usd. I was told to write to consumer service and they mention that it is piece concept and not per kilogram which is Not mentioned in their webpage.I had to spend more money than I had and I am feeling very unhappy about it
12,Absolutely awful airline they really don't know how to do their jobs properly. Both on the way to ciaro and on the way home from cario our luggage was lost! Worst airline ever!! Will never fly with them again
13,"If this is the pride of Egypt then its laughable, wannabe Emirates airlines with completely poor customer service in Cairo. Cant do anything to help, male dominated yet incompetent. Delayed my flight by 7hours yet offered no compensation, replacements or anything making me miss my connection flight which I then had to pay for again. Egyptair is the laughing stock of Arab airlines, total shambles, plus also a reflection of your country. Very laughable."
14,"YOU SKIP THIS HEADS-UP AT YOUR OWN RISK.Do not ever board Egypt air from UAE to any part of Africa. All their options including the most expensive economy have long hours of layover yet its STRICTLY no accomodation for anyone to and from UAE. You will be forced to sleep on the hard chairs amidst the mosquitoes and the cold atmosphere.Their staffs are arrogant, very rude and treat you like you begged them to let you fly with them. They would shut you down arrogantly and leave you with no explanation. Unfortunately for me I booked a round trip so I had to go through this horrible situation twice.Their seats are dirty and my phone was all soiled up after accidentally dropping it in the pocket behind the seat. My luggage delayed for 2days upon reaching and I had to drive for over 3hrs just to come back for my luggage.By far this has been the most humiliating and embarrassing moment of my travel life as a blogger. It might cost you a little extra but its worth it choosing other airlines over Egypt air."
15,Canceled flight. After waiting at the gate for an hour. No announcement at all.
16,Egyptair customer service are very nice and quick response through email. My travel agent wasn't responding and I was chasing them for two months for my confirmation but when I emailed directly to Egyptair  they responded me within half an hour and they confirmed my flights within two hours which was very surprised for me and sent my e tickets straight away. A very very big thank you egyptair I hope flight journey would be pleasant too.
17,"Surprised at all the negative feedback.I had a recent cancelled Easyjet flight so had to book last minute with EgyptAir, London-Hurghada. Nothing bad to say at all. Staff were friendly, food was nice, all processes were smoothly followed. One of the flights left late but we still arrived early. I think the communication on that was a bit poor as whoever was collecting me thought we were arriving a lot earlier, not sure what happened.But overall I was pleasantly surprised with the whole journey and service!"
18,"Atleast they make an effort to let their darker skinned African/African American passengers know they are disliked by the staff . The staff in Cairo will literally ignore someone speaking directly to their face , especially if you don’t speak Arabic . Flight wasn’t the most unpleasant but stewards just as rude and unhelpful."
19,"Cancelled 3 tickets after 10 hours of making the booking, submitted form online 26 working days ago and nothing till now! They never picking up calls no matter what time or which office in Cairo you called ! I’m taking it farther up will leave reviews everywhere and i will go to their office and recored them video if will not be solved will make case ! Such thieves please be aware do not book with EGYPTAIR"
20,"The worst airlines.Firstly, the passengers of the flight took bags and suitcases in their hand luggage that did not correspond to the sizes declared by the airline. All hand luggage in size was not placed on the luggage racks. At the same time, no one controlled the weight or size of hand luggage during check in. The crew also did not even make comments about this. Secondly, our online check-in for the flight was canceled due to the fact that a person with limited mobility was flying with me and we ordered the meet and assist service. In view of this, we already got only seats in front of the evacuation exit 22 A, B, where the seats do not recline. How can an elderly person with limited mobility spend 5 hours of flight in such a position?! Thirdly, the meet and assist service at Cairo Airport was provided poorly. Everything was late, very slow, the wheel chair was not get it  at once.Fourthly, when loading an elderly person with limited mobility on board an airplane in Cairo (flight MS 222), we were held for 30 minutes in the sun in the heat in front of the closed door of the plane because the flight attendants first started launching all passengers and only then a passenger with limited mobility, which contradicts the rules of all airlines.Fifthly, during the flight MS 222 Cairo-Sharm el Sheikh, our luggage was not loaded on board, it was simply forgotten in Cairo, which is why we had to return to Sharm El Sheikh airport again after a few hours to collect our luggage. We are very dissatisfied with the services of Egypt Air. Of all the airlines we have flown, this is the worst. It's a shame that Egypt Air is part of the Star alliance. I hope we will never have to use the services of Egypt Air again."
21,The worst airline company ever.Hello DearAs it shows we were able and allowed to travel to Ethiopia with only  Rapid test but the ground steward and the supervisor at Düsseldorf airport made us take an unnecessary PCR test which we had to buy and pay expensively .They told us we can't check in unless we have a PCR test certificate so they refused to accept the Rapid test certificate!!!On the flight back from Addis Ababa to Düsseldorf we had a delay of bags 5 totally which were left behind deliberately because they make more money out of cargos meaning i had to wait 10 days before have them delivered at my home address. 1 star too much actually. So people before you choose egypair think twice coz not only there price is cheap but there service is very very bad.I have sworn never to fly ever again with egyptair.
22,Crew Members were rude and there are disparities in the way they  treated customers within the continent of Africa  to the way they treat their customers outside the continent of Africa.
23,"Terrible customer service - do not book a connecting flight!We have a return flight from Nairobi to London, stopping in Cairo. Egyptair have changed the flight time of Nairobi to Cairo flight to a later time but not our connecting flight. This means our connection will have departed for London before we even reach Cairo airport!! After 5 requests to change our flights to another, being flexible by +3days and even offering to pay more to upgrade to business class seats, the airline has rejected all requests and not offered any solutions to return us home to London. Looks like we are going to have to pay another £2000 to book a return flight with another airline. I cannot express my frustration with this airline, I truly do not understand how they would do this."
24,Worst airlines ever! They damaged our babystroller that's worth over 10000 pounds and they will only refund us 3000 pounds for it & that's after we had to fight with them!!! Never ever going to use this unserious company again and never ever recommend it to anyone we know.
25,"If this is the pride of Egypt then its laughable, wannabe Emirates airlines with completely poor customer service in Cairo. Cant do anything to help, male dominated yet incompetent.

27,"I hate Egyptair very much. Bought a return ticket unfortunately so I was forced to use them again. That would justify this second bad review. You know how taking someone to the lung cancer ward helps with getting people to stop smoking... well, if you want someone to quit traveling make them fly Egyptair. Let me count the ways I hate Egyptair:1) Took the time to write another review to warn others not to use them.2) Didn't eat the food they were serving. I thought the beef meal presented at dinner was beef ribs until I stuck my fork in it and realized it was dogfood lasagne. Packets of cheese had discoloration (old cheese). This wife's chicken had a certain aroma, luckily it took away her hunger. 3) No extra water. 200ml of water, no more. If you're dehydrated that's your problem.4) Waited 1 hour for my first bag to come out of the baggage area. Nobody is around to let us know what's going on. Just you staring at the conveyor belt with no end in sight after a 14-hour flight. Subsequently, this made me miss my bus and I had to wait 2 extra hours for the next one.5) Stupid staff. The first of our connecting flights was late by 2+ hours. Making us nervous as to whether we would catch our second Egyptair flight. When we landed staff got cross at us for being late. Have you ever just stared at someone and come to realize that those warnings on bleach bottles actually serve a purpose.6) Security officer touched my dick twice when doing a routine body search. He nearly suffered blunt force trauma but luckily for him, there was no third attempt.Don't ever fly with Egyptair. Some companies deserve to go bankrupt."

30,I recently had a flight from London with Egypt air and had received my locked luggage zip open and some of my valuables missing. I had sent an email to the baggage team but havent received any reply.
31,"First the plane is very dirty, it’s not cleaned, and the planes are old. I also noticed when you take their plane in Africa, their attitude is very bad, they dint give you pillows or blanket, I noticed it twice but they change when you flying internationally to Canada or the US"
32,Absolute garbage. Wanted to save money for the cash we paid. Most utter disappointment I have ever seen. More like riding a garbage truck not a plane. ****
33,"I have been trying to book flights on this company fpr 1h30mns to enter all required details 3 times.Website is complicated and while am booking, it reloads with a 250euros more than what i was booking..Price is already so high that i wll search for another company, even with a stop. Better than this opportunistic company!😏"
34,Site does not accept US credit cards no matter how many different ones I try.
35,"Cancelled 3 tickets after 10 hours of making the booking, submitted form online 26 working days ago and nothing till now!

36,"WORST SERVICE EVER!Flight MS849 Cairo NairobiI just landed in Nairobi from Cairo (coming from Rome) with my 2 kids (11 and 6). Cabin crew rude and discriminating.Asked for blankets for my kids, they gave only to Muslim passengers. European and African passengers where not given and replied in a rude manner ""NO! WE DON'T HAVE"".Cabin crew looks and behave rude, even to the kids asking a simple glass of water. You may need to understand this simple concept:CHEAP FLIGHT DOESN'T NECESSARY JUSTIFY YOUR CHEAP SERVICE AND RUDE TREATMENT.I will never fly with you again, EVER! And be sure that I'll spread bad reviews for the next 12 months and to my 100k followers.You never know who's flying in economy class. I will also write to Skytrax as I am in contact with their media office.Good luck with your cheap airline! You don't have a bright future ahead...YOU RUDE, INCOMPETENT, CHEAP and RACIST!My kids left the aircraft with running nose and shaverin. You will pay for that. Not only in reputation. Allah knows what to do... OH, yes, I forgot to say, I'm a Muslim too. Should I have told you before to ask for blankets?"
37,Hi the Egypt Air check person at Heathrow incorrectly marked my luggage to be collected at my transit stop Cairo and not my end destination of Johannesburg as it should have been. She insisted this was the way its done.Behold I am now in Johannesburg without luggage as I could not and was not allowed to pick up my bags at Cairo.The Egypt Air staff at Cairo did nothing to help.They just say lodge a complaint and case. Nothing more to discuss. Rude and dismissive to the point of the agent told me to go back and take another flight from where I came from and speak to the check in there. What an absurd experience.
38,"MS754 Madrid to Cairo, $400 Business Class Upgrade on 27 May 2022.  STAY AWAY!!!!    Unhealthy, foul, unsanitary airline.  An environment perfect for respiratory diseases and Covid 19 viruses, which are currently in their global prime.  I paid an additional 400 USD for the upgraded ""privilege"" of sitting under these air vents for 4 hrs, as did all the other passengers.  The filthiness of this airline complements their staff response when the issue was brought to their attention.  I requested an upgrade for this flight and it was accepted for $400 additional USD, which made this 4 hr disgusting flight a $750 journey.  The attendant cabin crew was not responsible per say, but it is their daily work space.  The blame for this Covid19 soup lies squarely upon completely inept management, poor (non-existent) quality control and cultural apathy, as evidenced by their response.  Please imagine a family member of yours with respiratory problems and then look at the pictures of 3 weeks ago.  This is not a ""one-time"" incident of cleaning oversight.  This was how the entire cabin looked and not doubt, the rest of their fleet.  The food may have been tasty but I spent the majority of my time swatting flies away.  Corporate response (paraphrased) was a cut and paste of  ""Sorry - we will look into it"".   I will drink a gallon of wastewater from Ganges river in India before I ever fly with this airline again.  Truly a disgusting business venture that should be prohibited from carrying passengers..... camels maybe.  On second thought, no, not even camels.  Absolutely deserving of the exceptionally poor reputation they have earned.   There are always alternatives.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this unsanitary and uncaring group of faux professionals trying to run an airline."
39,Delayed flight on way to Aswan and delayed currently waiting to board to Istanbul via Cairo. Avoid
40,"Really bad experience, fees needed to change plane date within 24 hours of booking"
41,"I had 4 trips with Egyptair last weekAmsterdam - CairoCairo - LuxorAswan - CairoCairo - AmsterdamOn the first trip they explained de emergency door to everyone expect to me (a women) THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD FOR EVERYONE who would need my assistance during an emergency. When we asked the vegetarian meal they told us; just take the chicken and throw the meat of.The toilet was disgusting everything wet of water I hoped, but the smell told me otherwise. After cleaning the nessecerry part to releave myself I thought how upset I would be if this plain would be my investment. Urine walked all over the carpet of your plain and the health hazard for people/children on-board. The other flight was no different only that it left very late. They started boarding and busses were already bringen people to the plain just to bring them all back again after 15 min.  due to technical failure of the plane so the told us. Well that felt like a comfortable thought. We think an could see something else going on but I don't want to go there because it is more speculation than fact on my part.Iside noten Aswan some guy from customs was standing before the toilets and whispered money money just before I walked in showing some bills he was holding in his hand. I know this is not allowed so I pulled up an eyebrow and asked him a bit to loud money?!?! he  then  replied  no toilet mam toilet en left.Will be sending customer service at Aswan an email about that. CORUPTION IS A SAFETY HAZERDMy only compliment goes out to the people working at the incheck desk. very good, hardworking and kind people every time.Pay a bit more, search a little harder because you do not want this to be the beginning and the end of your trip."
42,"I recently flew with Egypt air during a trip with family. We were meant to have five flights: one from the US to Cairo, two from Luxor to Amman, and two to get us back to the US. Before our trip, we were notified that the second flight from Luxor to Amman had been cancelled, and we had been rebooked for a flight five hours later. Because it was a connecting flight, this meant we had a layover five hours longer than we had planned. We were given no reason why our flight had been cancelled, no apology for the change, and no compensation offer. While this was frustrating as it changed our travel plans, we did not complain. However, in the middle of our trip, we were notified that the first of our flights back to the US had been cancelled, and we were rebooked for a different flight 2 DAYS later. Note that the second, connecting flight, was still booked for the original date and egypt air had not changed that. Again, there was no explanation, apology, or compensation. After hours (of vacation time) spent on the phone with and in the offices of Egypt air, we learned that both our cancelled flights were cancelled simply because they were not fully booked. Egypt air said the only thing they could do was refund the cost of the flight that we had not yet used (the return flight). This could not possibly cover us booking flights with a different airline for our original date, as this happened only a week before we were flying and all flights were more expensive at that point. Egypt air refused to provide housing for us or rebook us on another carrier. I’m not sure how they expected us to make our connecting flight that was still for the original date. In addition to all of this, at the airport, we approached an Egypt air help desk to ask about our flights and try to get compensation. After being ignored for several minutes by 6 agents not doing any other work, we were finally helped. However, in the middle of us talking, the agent took a cell phone call and ignored us again. Finally, we were told they could not help us at that desk, the only desk that we could be helped at was outside the terminal (which we couldn’t get to), but they couldn’t do anything anyway so not to bother. Overall, this was by far the worst flying experience any of us have ever had. Horrendous customer service. Egypt air has guaranteed that none of us will ever be flying with them again, and I urge anyone else who wants even a halfway decent flying experience to avoid Egypt air at all cost."
43,"I rarely write reviews, especially negative ones, but this review needed to be written. EgyptAir is the absolute worst airline I have ever experienced. Staff that absolutely don’t care about travelers. I’m absolutely disgusted by the way I was treated. I had a flight from Luxor to Alexandria via Cairo. I showed the attendant my boarding passes while checking in my bags. He told me that the boarding passes were no longer relevant because the flight changed. Without any explanation of what actually changed. Then he gave me boarding passes to Cairo only, and marked my luggage to arrive in Cairo. I stopped him and tried to explain that I’m going to Alexandria. He corrected me and said that I’m mistaken. That my flight was only to Cairo. I explained that I have proof I have two legs on EgyptAir from Luxor to Cairo and then from Cairo to Luxor. He insisted that I was wrong, despite the ticket I presented. Then another attendant started searching for my ticket at the next counter over after seeing how frustrated I was. New information emerged. My flight from Cairo to Alexandria was apparently canceled and I had supposedly received an email. No email was received. The attendant then proceeded to explain that I needed to stop in Cairo, pick up my luggage and then file a complaint. No attempt to book me on an alternative flight was made or secure accommodations for me. I’ll be landing at night, around 9pm. I don’t live in Cairo, and don’t have a hotel reservation there. I argued that this isn’t how airlines should handle cancelations. I asked to speak to a manager, and Mr Kamal Mohammad Ahmed (my attempt at reading the scribbled name he gave on a torn piece of paper), the first attendant, ridiculed me by saying he’s the manager and that there is nothing further to discuss. Just like those comedy shows where everyone is the manager. I picked up my boarding pass to Cairo and walked away. I felt humiliated. I felt ashamed to be an Egyptian. I felt disgusted by the staff at EgyptAir. So much for Egyptian hospitality. I plan to drive from Cairo to Alexandria. I will be making no attempts at booking another flight with them. In any event, be careful when booking and safe travels!"
44,Absolutely horrible airline with the worse customer service. They lost my baggage and I’ve been through hell with them. They don’t seem to care about their customers at all. They never reply to your emails and calls. Not worth the headache. Stay away !!
45,"I had a really good experience with Egypt air. The food was great, the service was good and they are really friendly staff! We lost our phone when getting out of the plane in Cairo, and we had a transfer. We informed the security and the staff at the plane checked our seats but couldnt find anything. after 30 min search they found it below the plane, since it fell when we where outside. They came with it and we really had an amazing service! Best staff and really good quality. I got a bit of noseblood because of air pressure, the staff helped me so much with getting ice and check up on me. Everything from food to the staff on craft was really good! The stewards are the best and deserves a lot of credit!"
46,"I am a frequent flyer and have to say EgyptAir is definitely the worst airline I have ever used. London Heathrow to Luxor return flights end of May 22. Very old planes. Terrible food. Only offered a 2 small cups of water on a 5 hour flight. They also ran out of water so we were incredibly thirsty (the plane was very hot). No other soft/ alcoholic drinks available. Poor service, stewards spent most of time watching Tik Tok videos at back of plane. Expensive flights for very little provided. I can imagine Business Class wasn't much better. If possible choose another airline to your destination."
47,Poor experience! I used egyptair travelling from Dubai to egypt return. On the way to egypt my flight was delayed 1.5 hours apart from that everything was normal nothing particularly impressive and nothing particularly off putting. My journey bag was terrible. After having an operation I called and requested to have wheel chair assistance and I was informed this would be available on my arrival to the airport and someone would call me on the day. I received no call. On arrival to the airport there was no assistance pre security and I paid a porter to help and had to manage. I was then informed there was no egyptair representatives available as I was early and wheel chair assistance was only available after check in. I sat and waited when check in finally opened (about 1 hour late) the flight was delayed 2 hours this time. I was finally provided with a wheel chair and taken to check in I asked for a spacious seat with easy access or I was happy to pay to upgrade. I was allocated a seat which I was promised was spacious and no need to upgrade. Upon going to the aircraft: 1. Aircraft was very unclean 2. The seat allocated to myself was in fact very small and restricted more than the ordinary seat 3. Was refused an upgrade which I was happy to pay for4. Was told by staff they couldn’t assist me in putting my bag in the over head.5. People behind me were complaining about lack of blankets and their kids being too cold. The airline had none to provide.This all seemed down to a specific gentleman from ground control who was the same one that checked me in. Really unprofessional service won’t be using again.
48,"I have still not received refund from Egyptair since March 2022 for a flight Eguptair decided to cancelled. I phoned the local office but that number does not exist. I phoned the international number and was transferred to 5 different ""customer care"" operators until the line disconnected. I have emailed them to their online refund email since March 2022 and have not received my money as promised - DO NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE"
49,Very poor service. Flight attendances do not seem care even when my call button was lit.Worst business class ever.
50,"On 7/05/2022 travelled with Egypt Airbus 330-300 flight no Ms 779 from Cairo to London their customers service is rubbish one of cabin crew prevented me from using one of the toilets he was very rude  he to told me don’t use this toilet  go go. I asked another cabinet crew for water he asked me to follow him and get water for my self while he was giving water to white guys in front of me while they were sitted, there is no equal opportunity  I will never recommend Egypt air to any one it is rubbish,rubbish rubbish"
51,"If we checked in at hurghada airport one check in stuff member tried  to sell us the emergency seats for 15€ per person , I am pretty sure this is not allowed . If we said no to that, he immediately changed his mood and precisely checked the weight of our luggage. We have 20kg plus 7 hand luggage and he told us that we have 4 kg overweight and tried to charge extra ,  even we were perfectly under the total amount. That is absolutely unbelievable that the airline treat their customers like that , nevertheless they have no service on board and unfriendly rude stuff - THIS is not acceptable!!"
52,"On Sunday 27th of March I had a flight from Cairo Airport to Barcelona  The initial flight MS767 was supposed to depart at 11.05 am but after waiting 1.5 hours , departure and then going back to the airport the craft was landed again due to technical reasons. To sum up the flight was delayed in total 5,3 hours that meant we left at 16.30 pm instead of 11.0 am.The problem with this is that I had a connecting flight from Barcelona to Alicante (Spain) which of course I lost because of the 5,3 hours delay.                                 Because of this I had to stay 1 night in Barcelona and incur in additional expenses such as accommodation, dinner and another means of transport to go to Alicante the next day.There was nobody at the airport representing the company to even ask if we needed any assistance, what would happen to passengers who had other connecting flights, it was 21.00 pm and there was no other flights, buses or trains and I had to organize that night in Barcelona all by myself and apart from that I had to take one day leave from work and as I said with no one at the airport or in the plane asking if we needed any assistance because of the 5,3 hours delay.I have been writing to customer service ever since but after just one apology and lame excuse they did nothing and have not responding to my emails ever since.They just dont care"
53,Best airline in the world
54,"The worst airline ever with rude, racist and ignorant staff members with poor communication skills. They refuse me to board hence I was in transit due to untruthful reasons. How can they say my documents are invalid while I used the same documents to travel several times. They dont respect black people and they are only friendly to those that speak Arabic. They scream to passengers. Their airport is unhygienic including their Airport Hotel with dilapidated bathrooms. They are refusing to provide WiFi access to passengers both on board and st the airport. All in all this airline is operated by racist, rude, worst, disrespectful, bullies, humiliators and inconsiderate staffs."
55,We arrive at Heathrow to flight to luxor but could not check-in as they were still check-in flight to cario.After about 45 minutes check-in was on business class so went though to the lufthansa lounge that was very very poor very poor choice of food and drinks.As for egyptair planes business class it is just not worth the money only got one bottle of water small. Tin of coke and one cup of coffee beside giving out the food which was OK. The crew were asleep they were when I went to the toilet which are extra small I'm not big there was just enough room to turn around overall the plane looks old and dirty as for TV its so small had a hard time looking at it. And then too make worse they lost our luggage it has been 12 days now and still haven't got a clue to whereabouts of it and egyptair so called wecare team are a joke should be called we DON'T care team. I will never flight egyptair again I would go without a holiday than go with egyptair again please save your money and go with another airline. Because egyptair as to be one of the worst airline in the world.Because as soon as you mentioned compensation which we are own they just don't want to know.
56,"This is the most unprofessional and incompetent set of people. Our flight was set to depart from JFK airport on 3/31/22 at 5:15pm. Upon check in at 1pm (4hrs before the flight), they were telling us that the flight is delayed one hour. This is important to note because for those that are regular travelers, you know that a delay is usually last minute and not something known 4 hours in advance. The plane was actually there but we did not board the plan until 8:30 pm. Once on the plane, we sat for an hour before being notified that the flight was cancelled. When we deboarded the plane, we were told to go back to the check in area. When we arrived, we were told there are no refunds and we cannot get our baggage. They said the plane needed “a piece” and it will arrive from Egypt the following evening. They were unable to provide a scheduled time for next flight and now said the original flight was delayed instead of cancelled. Many passengers missed connecting flights and many have decided to cancel travel due to this issue. However, they still have refused to refund or provide customers with their belongings. They have told customers “if you decide to cancel”. Wording is important because this takes the ownership off of them. Over 300 passengers (which included many infants and toddlers) waited at JFK airport until after 2am trying to get answers on their belongings or on another flight. They obtained 2 hotel rooms for 100 passengers. The rest of the passengers either went home or stayed in the airport. They asked people to leave their names and phone numbers and their boarding passes so they can call and say “when to come back to the airport”. Everyone was told different times to return to the airport- some were told 3pm and others 6pm. The manager, Ahmed, said he does not think the plane will leave before 8pm (over 24 hrs after the original flight time). The other manager, Omar, was useless and walked aimlessly back and forth texting on his cell phone. There is no certainty the plane will actually leave at all. Mashallah! The scene at the airport was complete chaos. Several papers with personal information for passengers, other passengers rummaging through the boarding passes of those who went home, lots of screaming and cursing. And the one word that was never said was SORRY! No apologies and no care on how this has affected others. There has been no intent on trying to provide answers or solutions. They even told those who want their luggage that the luggage will go to Cairo with or without them on the flight- a FAA violation. They do not care. This is an Egyptian airline and they follow Egyptian rules- their own rules. They do what they want and do not care about anything except making money."
57,"My flight was cancelled 4 days before departure; however, the customer service office in UAE did an absolute wonderful job of finding us 2 transfer flights. They were very friendly and attentive to the problem and figured out the difficult task of helping us depart Moscow during a time of limited flights. The main flight itself from Cairo to Washington (IAD) was comfortable and the cabin crew was friendly. The main dish was tasty and the included travel bag was a nice touch. The flight was clean and thought was put into not disturbing sleeping passengers on the red eye flight (Cairo-Dulles). In general the 12 hour flight was nice and arriving in Washington in the morning was pleasant. All together I was impressed with the airline for the way their customer service handled our problem and the flights themselves. I would only deduct that the snack meal provided could be with less bread."
58,I booked tickets Jeddah to london it was connecting flights my flights was 27th of March 24th March I received a text from Egypt airlines my flights from Jeddah to Cairo is cancelled but Cairo to london is on time I don’t understand how am I catch the flight Cairo to london who ever in Egypt airlines was dealing with this matter is extremely unprofessional I am warning everyone be careful buying tickets from Egypt airlines I suffered and lost lots of money and they ruined my holiday I will tell all my friends and family members and other media be careful to deal with Egypt airlines My original flight no was ms668
59,Ticket cancelled. No support available in any country. as no one ever picks the phone. The website is so backwards that nothing works there. Nothing literally. The only way is to get in touch with them is via a lawyer!
60,I JUST CONTACTED COUSTMER SERVICES TO UPDATE MY CHILD DATE OF BIRTH FOR MY UPCOMING TRAVEL TO EGYPT...AFTER AN HOUR AND 47 MINUTES ON HOLD ..I GOT A VERY VERY VERY RUDE PERSON AND AS SOON AS I TOLD HIM MY CONCERN HE SAID NO I CAN'T DO THIS AND HUNG UP ON ME ....NEVER AGAIN ...
61,"Rubbish. Absolutely disrespectful and rude staff. Will not answer your queries. Not worth it. Horrible customer service, horrible treatment of their customers. Bad airline."
62,Worst airline I have ever travelled with. Rude staff that don’t communicate anything. Flight delayed by hours with no explanation as to why. Terrible terrible customer service. Do not fly with them.
63,"Stay away from this cheating company. My son, along with a group of other boys, arrived at the Cairo airport well in advance, for return to Denmark. They were denied entry to flight with the claim that they had arrived late (they had arrived 3 hours before).It is hopeless to get in touch with them, they neither answering calls nor emails."
64,"Very worst experience in my life ever, zero  percent customer services. They are making us  fool."
65,Used Egypt Air for following route:ADD to CAI ( 4.5 hours late)CAI to LUX  LUX to CAICAI to SHHSSH to CAICAI to ADDAll flights were late ranging 45 mins to 4.5hrs. Our connecting flight was late to CAI and Egypt Air took no responsibility. We were forced to purchase new tickets to ADD and obtain our own hotel room. They have a boiler room style sales team at CAI. A $250 ended up costing us an additional $500 per person. Brutal with zero value for the customer well being. The part they are missing is how many people are affected when travelers are discouraged from traveling to Egypt. Lesson learned and will make best efforts never to repeat.
66,I have tried to use my credit for two cancelled flights last year and can't get through to Egyptair at all. The phone is always busy. There is no way of using the credit online and no instructions although they told me it would be easy to do. Terrible service. Now going to their offices in Hammersmith which is probably some lock up fake office. I will NEVER use them again.
67,"Terrible customer service. Placed a cancellation/refund request online on 1st December. Form says you do not need to do anything else to cancel your flight. Two weeks later I was still getting emails about the flight so I spent an hour and a half on the phone trying to speak to someone who told me it wasn't cancelled (I have a copy of the form I submitted). Now 2 and a half months later I have sent 3 more emails, sent countless messages on social media and I still haven't received any form of refund. Will never use them again."
68,"Would give a negative rating if possible.Absolute awful service in long haul business class flight, flew from Johannesburg to London Heathrow via Cairo and both flights had business class toilets closed, staff were rude and service was just about non existing. They cancelled my return flight and could not re book a flight at a time suitable to myself,  had to request a refund in December and still waiting for any response, have tried contacting again by email but no response. There are plenty of alternative airlines that I can use, so I won't ever recommend egyptair"
69,"An airline with very poor customer service that never fails to disappoint in both economy and business class over and over. What can I say about the ""available"" customer service starting from help with flight reservation changes? or check in service at the counter? or boarding and meeting with a crew whose costumes look like they serve in the military? or service on board the flight? or their unappetizing poorly made stomach-turning sandwiches they serve to substitute for meals for flights to Europe? (I advise to bring your own food when you fly on this Egypt air) not to mention their beverage service that provides juice boxes to customers on both economy and business as if they are kids? Very patronizing! And So much moreto say!!!"
70,1 star is just too muchno servicecant callno reply
71,No refund from 40 days. No response on phones or emails. I only booked with them because they are the only carriers have direct flights to Cairo. They have to be more keen to develop their service.
72,"My booking has been changed by Egyptair. Since this did not suit me, I wanted to change the second flight to a flight that was convenient for me. I tried to call the London office, was on hold the whole time and £30 was taken from my mobile account, although I never got through. There was no answer to my emails. This is the worst service ever!"
73,The canceled my flights and they only emailed me that the flight is canceled and contact the office. While I was in Siwa and no good access to the internet. I tried to email me to support and no answer. I contacted the egyptair using the 1717 number and the answering machine hung up after saying we have high volumes of calls. There was no way for me to contact them and I had to purchase a new ticket. When I was back they refused to answer the emails and basically my money and my vacation got wasted.
74,"Worst experience I've had in an airline. They lost my bag, don't answer e-mails or calls. Adding to this, the service from them at the Nairobi airport was a disaster. I would highly recommend not to ever travel in this airline. Food was terrible also, and staff were not friendly at all."
75,"I booked a flight from EU to South Africa. It was cancelled on the 27th of November due to the new variant announcement, I applied for a refund on the 2nd of December from their refund portal and I received the full refund on the 30th of December. I did have to email them to follow up on the 27th of December but I received the full refund shortly afterwards."
76,It was the most horrible flight yesterday no entertainment no movies to watch.  Plus the flight was delayed until 19:40 and left at 19:50 for take off we arrived at 8:31pm into terminal one at Sharm el Sheikh. I wasn’t very with the way people just kept on pushing in front of us to board the plane
77,"Very helpful & friendly staff staff crew. I had one missing document for my trip, they explained to me my problem very politely & said don’t worry , you will not miss your flight, thank goodness! Also told me what to say when I arrive to immigration office there ! Wow thanks guys"
78,"This is the worst airline you will ever encounter. Always facing delay , unprofessional staff and most of all very expensive . I believe this airline should shut down business as they offer the most horrible service. Unbelievable service in 21 century . Management should be changed and new way of management should be introduced since it is declining year over year without any attention to the system"
79,I received a respond on Facebook messenger
80,"Our flight MS 738 on October 24th, 2021 from Istanbul Airport was a night mare!!! ---- I emailed to ""WE CARE"" Egyptair, all I received after 6 weeks was my ""case number"".I wanted to think that Egyptair will TAKE CARE of my complaint soon.  I will post it after is resolved !"
81,They canceled our trips for purely commercial reason on short notice without providing explanation or alternatives plus they never answer the phones and refuse to provide refund for that and compensation
82,I booked a flight through Travelgenio - Cancellation request created - CA-104706 - My request has been created and will be handled by one of Travelgenio's agents - since Monday 6.01AMI received an email from ONLINEREFUND- EGYPTAIR to say kindly note your online refund requisition has been received and is being processed What is going on - Egypt Air all other airlines have refunded meI was supposed to fly out to Egypt on Monday with Ethiopian Airlines (had a boarding pass already) they have given me a full voucher for the value of the ticket.My flight with Egyptair is only booked for the 9th of December 2021 - and I requested to cancel my booking as all South Africans are banned to fly to Egypt - I paid for two passengers and canceled my booking due to the Egyptian Federation that canceled all South African citizens to travel to Egypt.Travelgenio I am not going to leave this matter here - I will take further steps and will also make sure on all websites that Travelgenio should not be used - If I cancel my flight online is shows zero refundthis is unacceptable and Egypt Air has sent an email to say my refund request has been received.  You have until Tuesday 7th December else taking this matter to consumers
83,"My name is Rita Malinga. I bought a return ticket for myself. I travelled with Egyptair on the 20/12/2021 from Heathrow to Johannesburg. Due to the OMICRON, i had to cut my trip short and come back on the 26th November 2021 on a Turkish Airlines flight after unsuccessfully trying to contact Travelgenio and Egypt air. Travelgeo said i should contact the airline straight of which they never provided me with a contact information. The number was notfunctional. This is a scam company interested in only making money for no service. I'm so disappointed that Egyptair and Travelgenio make it difficult for me get my refund, yet i opted for the extra £41 refund cushion. The other one blames the other. TraveIgenio told me to ask my refund from Egyptair and Egyptair says the same about Travelgenio. I will not recommend that anyone should use their services. I want my money back.Regards Rita Bongiwe Malinga 07384315346"
84,"I was standing outside the washroom and was the only guy in line . At that time air hostess guy came next to me and start yelling at me badly . I asked him that have I done anything wrong he responded back with saying if you want to use washroom than stand behind the line (the line was more closer to passenger side)  . I was so confused I never knew this rule before  . I apologies to him and was about to go to stand behind the line but, this kept on yelling and all of his other colleagues too start laughing at me . Felt really bad about this incident. Seems like those guys were trying to badly bully me . My flight was from Toronto To Cairo ( Ms 996)"
85,I believe the website is easy to understand and smooth. I experienced some problems before with errors but I figured out how to avoid them and it does not occur often.
86,I asked for a refund because Egyptair canceled the flight. I wait now for more then 1 1/2 year for an answer.  First the say I have to ask the agency. This agency gave up after a year. Now I try myself but they just don't answer properly.The flights are ok.
87,"Useless customer service number since no one answer the calls, and online check in is a waste of time as the airline ""unfortunately we don't have online checkin counters"". Then why the hell do you provide this as a service and ask travelers to waste their time sticking luggage codes?Anyway that's an Egyptian business so they also tend to ignore users reviews assuming that no one reads it"
88,I'm a world traveller...Yesterday on 5th November 2021 I travelled from Heathrow Airport to Cairo Airport on ms778 on chair 20 G Dr.Hassan Fouad Wahba... I was very happy for everything specially hospitality from well trained crew specifically the well trained professional Mai Abouda and other one his nick name the Pharaoh or Phara'on...Thanks alot Egyptair for let me happy and satisfied and enjoy 5 hours of travelling...thanks alot Mai and Pharaoh or Phara'on...
89,"Please please avoid this airlines no matter what. Even if you’re desperate. My flight was in the early morning from Addis Ababa to Copenhagen. I went to the airport 2hrs prior to my flight as the airport is not busy at all. I bought an extra lagged through the travel agency I booked my ticket, however when I was trying to check in, I was told they couldn’t find the payment for the extra lagged I added in their system, though I showed them the confirmation email I got from the travel agency. But still I was asked to pay for the extra lagged, otherwise I won’t check in. So I was like okay it’s fine, I will ask for a refund when I go back to Copenhagen. So the total amount was almost 300 dollars, and I took off my credit card from my pocket and I was told they don’t accept credit card, but only cash. I was like how am I supposed to have that amount of money in cash  when I’m leaving the country I had been staying for 3 months. There were no ATM around. So I couldn’t able to check in and missed my flight, tho I had money in my credit card.  The Egyptian guy at the check in counter was very rude. He was like “ no, you’re not getting on the plan if you don’t have cash, so go home” that’s what he said.That made me book another flight with Ethiopian airlines and I still payed for the extra lagge by credit card . I missed my flight because this well known Egypt air does not have A payment terminal in Bole airport ( one of the most well known airports in Africa) Even normal restaurants in Addis Ababa have A payment terminal. I was so disappointed, but I also learned my lesson on the hard way that to never ever fly with Egypt Air."
90,"Disgusting air line ,I never ever seen in my life, very rude thief people  like Egypt , hireable Costmer service , very very very bad 😡😡😡😡"
91,"I love Egypt, and I straight up Never want to come back here because of EgyptAir in Cairo. They are horrible. They treat you like 2nd class citizens, not a paying customer. After arriving to my 9:30 flight at 8:40, they just closed checkin. The manager, Karim abd el something, got rude and pissy. Another Omar told me to sit down. I told them 10 times my Arabic is bad, and basically they told me to screw off, you're not getting on this flight. After asking Deputy Manager Mohamad Hussain about the rules, he just kicks me out of the office and asks me to go somewhere else. and I noticed each and every officer started mistreating me and giving me looks because I look Egyptian. I cannot believe how they treat people here."
92,"one of the worst airlines in the world, you can not even talk to anyone"
93,"Bad bad bad I’m a resident of the Uae, I came home(Ghana) for vacation, after the vacation was due, I lost my passport on my way to the Accra . I made a police report and affidavits and a new passport was issued to me , I went to the Uae embassy to make enquiries as to how best I can fly using my visa which is having the lost passport numbers in it . They gave me the best way to deal with this situation..I was asked to make an NOC (No objection Certificate), Police Extract, proof of residence ie an ID, old passport copy and I will be good to fly. All these details was made ready and I booked a transit flight using EgyptAir, On the 4th of October my flight day, the flight manager asked for all the mentioned details if I have them ready, and yes I had them all, I showed it all to them, he hold a name like Ahmed, he went away from the counter and later called the clearance team and said they cannot allow me to board the flight. No reason was attached, I left the airport stranded. I don’t recommend anyone to try this flight company, they are a complete scam, and hey they have a bait of getting people to choose them, that’s Their pricing it appears moderate but if you are a person with such reasons as mine don’t you ever choose EgyptAir. You will lose your money!"
94,"Terrible airlines, with the worst and most unreachable customer service. They canceled my flight not once but 3 times do to COVID, after giving the passengers a option to opt out of the flight and get a full refund, they are still processing the refund after 6 months. When you contact the customer support office in the Netherlands, no one ever answers the phone, like it’s just there for deco. All customer support agents are extremely rude, and act like you’re asking them for a freaking hand out and not your own money back! I stopped using EGYPTAIR and I will never recommend this airlines to anyone! Ever! Also booking a flight with The EGYPTAIR website doesn’t work and gives payment errors, it only works if you go book the flight with a third party, but if you do this they are even less helpfull if even possible. It’s hopeless!"
95,"Egyptair - a financial and payment system that does not work! I bought a ticket and tried to pay by credit card. This was not possible, as I got many errors. Then I paid by ""instant"" transfer. Since I got no confirmation after my booking, I contacted Egyptair and sent them a payment confirmation from my bank that proves that the amount was already debited (not just hold). Egyptair told me that I will get the ticket as soon as they receive the money. 3 days later, they informed me that I have to pay an additional fee, because the class booked is not available anymore. My friend bought the same ticket and paid later, her ticket was hold, so she got the same ticket she booked. Fazit:Egyptair financial and payment system does not function properly:Paying by credit card is associated with errors. They call a payment method ""instant"" transfer that doesn't not work instantly. For such system, the customer has to pay extra fees after booking and has stressful struggles taking to the call centre and sending emails to solve such problems."
96,"Impolite, rude and racist staff. Never go back to Egypt."
97,RUN!No way to communicate with them except through Facebook messenger. I even had to connect with them through Facebook to cancel my flight and get my refund (canceled within 24hrs). It’s been 3 months and they only gave me a partial refund with no explanation why they didn’t give me my full refund!
98,"Absolutely worst airline I have ever dealt with. My fiancée and I had a trip planned for April 2020. Obviously because of covid our entire trip was cancelled. All our hotels, tours, and airlines have us either a full or partial refund…. Except Egyptair. We were given a voucher with a one year expiry. We were informed that if the voucher was not used by the one year expiration that we would receive a refund. It has been 18 months since our flight was cancelled. The voucher has expired. I have sent multiple emails in regards to my refund over the past 4 months and Eygptair refuses to respond. This was the first and FOR SURE the last time I will ever book with this heartless selfish airline!!! I would never recommend them to a friend."
99,Just horrible..changing a flight was charge 450 dollars. The ticket itself had cost less
100,The experience from hell!By far the worse airline I have ever flown with. I travelled  business class and was no different in service from economy. Avoid at all costs.I have not one positive thing to say about Egyptair.
101,"Wish I could give zero stars. I fly pretty often, and Egyptair is by far the worst airline. We had a 10:10 flight out of Cairo to Frankfurt. We received emails to check in digitally that warned that if we were not at the gate 25 minutes prior to departure time, we wouldn’t be allowed on the plane. Knowing this, we got to the airport a couple of hours early. When we got to the Egyptair counter to get our printed tickets at 9:10, the man said that we were too late, and the flight was closed. He then told us to talk to another guy at a different desk. When we got to that desk, the man did not acknowledge us at all. My husband began to explain the situation, and the man waved us away (picture a shooing motion). When he finally agreed to help us, he said that it was policy, we couldn’t board the flight, and we would need to buy a new ticket. He claimed that it was the system, and it couldn’t print the tickets because we were “late.” A third man eventually helped us and was able to print off the tickets, so it appears that the second employee just lied. Thinking that we were somehow late for the flight, we ran through the airport to the gate to find out that they hadn’t even started boarding. The employees are not helpful at all, and quite simply put, lack common curtesy. For a separate flight, Egyptair didn’t email us the link to check in digitally until two days after the flight...that caused a headache to get in the doors of the Luxor International Airport. On a different flight, EVERY Egyptair flight was delayed without any information. No personnel were in the Alexandria airport to ask questions. Needless to say, we missed our connecting flight due to this."
102,"They have zero customer support, trying to reach them and everytime i get to reach them the poor guy says Hi and he hangs up to get back to playing or browsing or whatever he does"
103,"We booked tickets as part of a group to visit Egypt for a diving holiday. We were notified a week before our flight that the dates of our flights were changed. This was done without consulting us and we had to cancel our tickets and re-book with a different operator. We requested refunds for our tickets and now almost 4 months on we are being ignored. No phones are being answered and the worst part is we were told that they were just doing month end and our payments were part of the batch that needed to run after their month end was done. This was 2 months ago. I will not recommend Egypt Air to anyone in our diving community, which is sad because that is where a big chunk op Egypt's income comes from, diving holidays."
104,Egyptair is ignoring my requests on cancelled flight refunds. They have cancelled both my reservations and now refuse to issue out an amount paid for the flights. Impossible to reach out to them. Customer support is non existent. However looking at the rating here it doesn't look like they care much about their service level
105,"I have used a lot of the airlines for travel and to be honest, Egyptair is the worst of them all! The check in staff at Dubai airport has a real bad attitude, the cabin crew on the aircraft is even worse and then my internal flight was put on standby for no reason. If you have a choice, fly any other airline except these jokers."
106,"Where should I start? Oh boy. The ticket counter was a mess. Business class economy all mixed. I was asked 4 times from ticketing to plane for PCR test. Once was enough! Then I get to the gate after waiting for 2 hours to board, the person taking the ticket said I was not flying business. Which in fact I was. After a long tiring dispute over my seating class, turns out, I was correct. No apology. Just get on plane. Get to the plane, the lady at door doesn’t even greet me- stares blindly at me and demands my ticket. Ticket! She says. Ok. I get to my seat, the flight attendant is not even helping as she sees me struggling with my things and says nothing. Doesn’t say welcome aboard or hello. Just looks at me. Then I sit down and open my water, remove my stupid useless mask to drink, she immediately rushed over to tell me to put my mask on. I’m like what?? You see me wanting to drink and take my medicine and you demand I put it on!! As if we aren’t going to remove them to eat later! Super rude,  brainwashed and inconsiderate. Then she walks by several times ignoring me. Finally landing in Cairo, nothing from any flight attendants to welcome us there, nothing. Just barking orders at guests and being really rude. Steer clear of this 2 star airline"
107,"EGYPTAIR is a joke, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THEM!!!!My husband and I booked a flight to Egypt from New York in Feb 2020 for Dec 2020. EGYPTAIR changed our returning flights and we couldn’t accommodate the date change and had to cancel on Oct 15,2020. We are still waiting on our refund of $1800. We can’t get through to anyone for answers. I’ve called the NY office many times only to get disconnected or it’s a dead end with CSR. Emails just get forwarded to someone else but nothing happens. So frustrated and will not consider using EGYPTAIR again!!"
108,The worst!!!! Over 6 months since I cancelled and was promised a full refund of $1987 within 30 business days…. Still nothing. Every time I email or call I get absolutely no help whatsoever. Never again booking that airline.
109,"I had the worst experience with egyptair who have incompetent staff. After they reviewed  our PCR twice in Washington DC and no issues. We get on the plane to cairo, 12 hours flight and in cairo they found an issue with our PCR test and we were held at the airport in cairo for 9 hours and Egyptair refused to take any responsibility or help us get released when they approved our PCR tests. Egyptair knew we are sitting in a small terminal with no food for 9 hours and when we said we’re hungry they said they are preparing food for us. Half hour before released, because of friends support who reached out to connections to release us, and after I told the head of EgyptAir I’m going to sue them,  when EgyptAir brought us stupid dry sandwiches that I wouldn’t pay for to eat."
110,Egypt Air cancelled my son's booking due to covid in April last year. We requested a refund but we are still waiting. The Egypt Air office in Johannesburg has not being helpful at all!
111,Since last year April I've been waiting for the refund for the flight that was canceled due to covid. Until now nothing has changed. Please do not use the service of those airlines.
112,Pooe poor customer service
113,Dealing with Egypt Air is really a matter of wasting time and money. they are not professional and not transparent. Imagine that they canceled one of my flight without notice while  the flight is still available in their site for new booker just to take money for nothing.
114,"I took a flight earlier this year. There were three of us flying and all our luggaes came ten days after we arrived. We were told at the airport that we could claim vouchers for to buy stuff we needed due to the delay in our luggage arrival. We were to call and have that sorted out. We called severally with no response. We emailed severely and we were pushed around in circles. We were told to fill out a form which we did and never got feedback on that for months. We kept emailing and have been ignored. We had to spend over $500 to buy stuff when we arrived and because we did not have our suitcases due to no fault of ours and the airline does not want to take responsibility. We also had to postpone another trip we had to take because we had to wait for our suitcase, this also cost us money. I am very disappointed by this. I understand that unforeseen events could occur to make the luggages delay but i believe we should get some kind of reimboursement for this. Please be thoughtful of your customers."
115,"It's a difficult time for all airlines because of COVID and Egyptair is no exception. My flight was cancelled back in March 2020 and I have only just received the full refund. They could improve the information on their website, but throughout the period of waiting for my refund they always promptly and courteously responded to emails. Perhaps not everyone would appreciate the long wait, but I would rather they took time to process my refund than if the company folded and I got nothing. I would have no problem booking with Egyptair again."
116,"Another story here of a flight being cancelled and not refunded. They have quite simply stolen the money. If possible, you should avoid this airline. I wasn't even informed by the airline of the cancellation, but had to find out as I went to checkin online.As a national carrier, they are a disgrace."
117,a very decent company that provides everything for the customer never been to a such plane compared to the ticket price
118,"Horrible customer service experience. I booked a flight and I was ripped off over fees after cancellation because of issues with COVID restrictions, such a horrible customer services, cheap mentality. Definitely when I have to go to Egypt next time, Egypt Air will not be in my radar, doesn’t matter how cheaper they are compared to other airlines. Please guys avoid Egypt Air, fly reputable companies, even if you have to pay a premium, it will pay off in the future."
119,"Like in the other reviews, unfortunately I can confirm the very experience on EgyptAir. I travel in December from Uganda to Germany. EgyptAir manage to arrive late and added extra delays on the departure time. Arriving in Germany my luggage was gone.I had to keep on complaining and calling EgyptAir to deliver my luggage, when after one week my luggage finally arrived I found out EgyptAir staff “shopped” in my luggage’s and stole some of the times I was planning to use for Christmas. Reading the other reviews this seems to be a habit from EgyptAir staff. BE AWARE!!I claimed compensation, after EgyptAir try to put me off with peanuts and filling an official complaint with the European Airline consumer board EgyptAir responded after three long daily complaining months.  It is because the European Airline consumer board followed my case EgyptAir compensated me. THANK YOU EU.When it came to pay the damage, they EgyptAir staff again tried to play games with me. They kept on telling the money was not ready, than the money was not there, etc etc. After threating to pass this none willing payment of EgyptAir to the EU they suddenly could find the funds!I have to say the German EgyptAir staff are very understanding but helpless."
120,"I was supposed to fly to Denmark through Egypt! To be fully transperant, my e-ticket number is 0773518665356 Booking Reference: WCGEKFFlight: MS911. I was denied to check-in due and eventually didn't fly with Egyptair. The reason is that your staff says that my PCR  COVID 19 test was old! and despite my attempt to ask them if it's okay to take the Antigen test at the Dubai airport, the staff kept saying no. My PCR test was received on 19/3 03:50 and the check-in for the flight was 5:00 20/3!! Dubai time, the staff said that once I get to Denmark then the test would be too old. According to the Danish COVID19 requirement is that the test should be 24 hours old upon check-in, not upon arriving!!???  I have been treated very badly without any chance to speak and show my documents I was extremely ignored. I have the same day 20/3 booked a flight to Denmark from emirates (ticket number 176 2338808989) who accepted my PCR test (the same one denied by Egyptair) and as well they required me to take Antigen test from the airport which only takes 15 minutes (these guidelines I didn't receive from Egyptair). I require a full refund for my ticket from Egyptair. I'm very disappointed with the treatment I received from Mr. Essam (manager) and not only me, but he also treated everyone else badly and even his own staff!! Will never fly with Egyptair after this treatment and experience."
121,"No refund in over 6 months!I had a flight from Johannesburg to Cairo cancelled because of covid and was told to request a refund via the online refund form, I did this over 6 months ago! I have tried to call them and all I get is they are still waiting to process refunds from other customers and offered me a travel voucher... To be honest its pretty ridiculous I don't want a travel voucher I want my money back! I will never use this company again and I will make sure to inform any would be traveller to not use them either."
122,Very bad products. Customer services are not helpful and they can’t answer the basic questions. The flexibility to cancel tickets is very limited even if you have just made them and customer service rep would sometime quote a higher price. I will never use them again
123,"I scheduled a flight round trip flight from    Casablanca Morocco to Cairo Egypt on April 25    2020.  I paid the full amount of 499.73 with my  debit  card to Egyptair Ny (212)-938-3519 for one ticket. The next month of June 4th I  received  a cancellation notice from egyptair via email.  That same day I went to the ONLINEREFUND-  EGYPTAIR.COM and request a refund. I received a confirmation email from Egyptair confirming my request. On July 11th 2020 I received an email from  callcenteregyptair.com requesting my tkt number. I resend the tkt number. I    never received a response. on July 9th I file a    complaint with the better business bureau claim. I received no resolution and when tried to followed up The BBB had closed the case. I r@eopened a new tkt with the BBB. On Aug 31,2020 later received an email from Maria Papadakis Egyptair HR. informing me my request for a refund was being sent to accounting for processing. On Sept.21st 2020 I received an email from Lynn R. Luehrs,CTC. Egyptair requesting my tkt number again. I call her number 212/938-3519 and was able to speak to her. This is the first time I was able to speak to a person. I was told that Egyptair did not have my tkt number and when I provided it to her    she would send my request to the chief accountant. I gave her the information she requested. On Nov 4th 2020 I called back to check the status and was told she sent the request like she promised but he did not authorize a refund. She also said, ""I can't force him to give you a refund"". It is clear to me they are trying to keep my money. Never use Egypt Air. They have many agents within our system of governance who run blocker. You will no get a refund."
124,Very friendly and accommodating staff which made the flight much better giving the Covid restrictions.
125,2 months since they cancelled the flight and still not returned my money. They will either not return or hold my money for long time for non of my fault
126,"Amazing Airlines and very helpful customer serviceI had a flight planned to Cairo on the 24th of January 2021.  As per regulations I did the fit to fly test but unfortunately it came back positive ( less than 24 hrs before the flight ). I contacted the call centre who advised to send an email for which I got a very timely response. I followed the steps and I was given an open ticket ( for a year ), so I can book anytime after I test negative. I will only pay the ticket difference. I won't pay the No show fees. EGYPT AIR will be my first choiceTHANKS FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING and ACCOMODATING THROUGH THIS DIFFICULT TIME"
127,"Didn't refund the money when I had to cancel my flights due to UK government's travel ban, Tier 4 lockdown. When the UK government announced travel bank in Dec 2020, I had to cancel my flight. Egyptair refused to provide full refund."
128,"I wish there was an option to give them negative stars! I was on flight MS751 from Cairo to Budapest on 15 January, after my arrival to Budapest, I discovered 2 of my luggage were not there, I had to follow up with them for 9 days till I got my luggage! Only for things to be stolen from them! All my child toys and they were expensive! A gold necklace, even toiletries, shampoo, shower gel.. Etc I'm really at loss of words and just want people to think really carefully before flying with this airline since they got no integrity."
129,"What a terrible, awful airline service!This company stole my money. And the stewards in the plane stole myMothers insulin and wouldn’t return it.I went online to book extra baggage for my mothers travel booking and it wouldn’t work online. I tried calling the office number and they said go online and do it (its also more expensive over phone).The payment system took my money three times without adding extra baggage. I contacted the support email and they finally fixed it for me by giving the extra baggage but DID NOT REFUND MY TWO FALSE PAYMENTS!!Ive spent months chasing them with emails to refund my payments that the online system stole but no actionThey claim I am a valued customer but clearly that is a lie.I’ve now complained via my credit card company."
130,"My mother bought extra baggage online, at the cost of $200 a bag prior to her flight. She purchased 4 extra bags. When she arrived to the airport the day of her departure, the teller said there was no record of extra baggage purchase, so they charged her again for the four bags, at $280 a bag. When she arrived back in Canada six weeks later, she received her credit card statement and noticed that the airline charged her 3x for the bags that they said ""was never purchased"". Therefore, my mother was charged an extra $1600?!?!? My mother tried calling the airline and customer service multiple times, to no response back. No one would pick up the phone. This is absolutely ridiculous. This is theft. This is deceit. She's been trying to get her money back ever since she returned back to Canada in December, and she still hasn't received any help from the airline. Do not trust this company."
131,No refund at all for refundable ticket?they are playing agent-airline-agent-airline and then said YOU are responsible for no refund due to late cancellation whereas i contacted agent-airline 1 week before original flight.Beware!! they are worst
132,"Pathetic customer service.  Cancelled trip for health reasons just prior to Canadian government insisting on a travel ban in March 2020.  Not only will EgyptAir not refund my tickets, they even charged an extra $56 in order to process the non-existing refund!  They were so quick to take the extra $56 from my credit card, but now it's just ""crickets"" when I or my travel agent call to inquire.  If you want to be treated failed, DO NOT FLY EGYPTAIR !"
133,Worset ever what a shame .. trying to call for days no help no customer service to answer no standards.. u need new management immediately
134,"The customer service for the UK office is the worst, they don't pick calls, the voicemail is full and no response to the email and messages. I have been calling for days no one is picking. Really disappointed."
135,This company seriously changes my flight schedule. So they expect me to wait 26 hours on the airport instead of 2 hours. This is so absurd!!!!!!! Rather cancel it all but didn't took the cancellation insurance. So stuck on an airport for that period of time. Never ever Egypt Air again in my whole lifetime. I AM SO PISSED YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
136,The worst experience by every mile. Forced to stay one day at the airport in Cairo enroute Abuja from Washington without prior notice of one day layover. The ground experience was terrible from unfriendly staff and the supposed hotel is ramshackle! Tried previous refund too for several months but no response yet! Look for another airline for your good
137,"ABSOLUTE DISGRACE OF A AIRLINE. Was told I must pay 20 egy pounds to use the trolley for my luggage. Was charged 1,970 egy pounds for a extra bag. Was harassed by a janitor for tips when he insisted to walk me to my gate sign when I did not ask him for help. He demanded I pay him and was angry with the amount I gave him. Security confiscated my 50ml hand sanitizer and told me it was because they will provide me with hand sanitizer on the plane. About four men at security then began touching all of my belongings and picking up stuff they did not have any business of doing. To the point where I literally grabbed my stuff back out of their hands to pack back up. Also stole a 50ml spray out of my bag. Upon boarding the flight there was chewing up stuck to the side of the chair in front of me and bits of random papers stuffed in to my chair seat. I am absolutely horrified by this airline will not ever use again. PLEASE STAY AWAY!!"
138,Worset ever what a shame .. trying to call for days no help no customer service to answer no standards.. u need new management immediately
139,Worst airline ever! Dirty mismanaged planes and worse is when you ask a refund for the loss they cause. They will lead you in a maze and leave you to dry out. Lost my baggage and got it a week later and no apologies nor compensation for what I purchased for the week I had no luggage. Do not even think about booking Egyptair.
140,"Business class fully refundable ticket booked from Cairo to Casablanca in July 2019 for travel in April 2020 cancelled because of Covid. Refund confirmation received immediately on 16th March. Despite numerous emails and various contradictory responses no one at ""online refund"" will respond. Absolutely the worst service ever seen - phone calls and emails not now being answered. Appalling - will never fly this airline now!"
141,"16 December 2020 update.  The refunds eventually arrived, in full, so I have added a couple of stars.They are still short of stars because of #:1 Poor to non-existent communication,2 The long wait for the refunds.Original review:  They cancelled 2 bookings because of the Coronavirus outbreak.  Their website said that the refunds would be made 35 working days after the resumption of flights, which was on 1 July 2020.1 July 2020 plus 35 working days = 19 August 2020No refunds received."
142,"I had my flight from Cairo to Heathrow cancelled by Egyptair in March. 6 months later I'm  still waiting for them to refund me.They hide behind any excuse. Cv19, I didn't book direct, I didn't book on their website, etc etcAny reason they can think of to avoid their legal responsibility. With a heavy heart its off to court using the fasttrack process. Why do they make life SO difficult? Just pay what you owe."
143,"I've requested a refund for my cancelled flight (fully refundable) booked directly with Egyptair.com for 2 months and got nothing. No one answers the phone in the US, the WDC office has a number that's not connected to a service. I've sent e-mails to every e-mail I could find on their website, even contacted them via facebook. Their Egypt office forwarded my message to their refund office and got nothing other than lipservice. The worst Airline ever to book with. The first time and certainly the last time."
144,"Terrible experience !!For more than 5 months I am trying to get a voucher of my flight or a refund of the same to book with the new dates.The flight was booked with myholidays.com and they both play with me !!I always get the same answer ""we are working on it"".I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL HAVING A RESPONSE BACK, AND IF I HAVE TO DENUNCE YOU, I WILL DO !!This is desperating !!NEVER MORE AGAIN !!"
145,The worst customer service...i have booked EgyptAir return flights from Sharjah to Egypt through Rehlat and the flights got cancelled due to Covid 19...i have been following up since last 6 months and my request is being dodged and delayed giving reasons..it is my hard earned money and I have full rights to get my money back but Egyptair and Rehlat is delaying giving false reasons
146,"Name: Mohsen AbdelmalakBooking reservation #: SQQWFJFlight from Sanfrancisco , USA to Cairo,  Egypt On 09/05/2020My  ConnectIon  flights is JetBlue airways B6016 From sfo airport to JFK and  Egyptair MS 986 From JFK to Cairo, egypt.I have never been frustrated with an airline like this before, my flight from SFO to John F. Kennedy was scheduled to arrive 15:30 where I take my connection flight to Cairo, Egypt at 18:30. The Egypt air airlines canceled my first flight and re-scheduled  without even notifying me or checking if it will be suitable with my connection flight. They changed the first flight from SFO to John Kennedy to arrive at 17:46!!!!  How can I take the change flight in less than 45 min.? What if the first flight was late and I missed my second flight, it will be stressful for a 65 yrs old man like me to run in large John Kennedy airport between different terminals in 45 min.? I called the airlines to change the flight where I can get a reasonable layover so I don’t miss my second flight and the airline’s agents dont respond to email or telephone. Omg what can I see, I spent days trying to call 1000 times with no response and when they finally responded, they were so rude and decided for me that this layover is enough and I can’t change my flight, how can this be more humiliating! They changed my schedule and didn’t inform me and when I tried to reschedule they wanted to charge me extra, given the rudeness and the bad customer service. They hanged the phone when I tried to ask them to change, this happened with two different representatives, and would not pick the phone again when they see my phone number. I don’t know what to do because of a schedule change with no reasonable accommodation. I am so stressed and I booked another return flight with another airlines. I will sue the egyptair airlines for the inconvenience and stress they caused to an old man like me. I have never experienced anything like this with other airlines. If egyptair cannot accommodate and respect their costumers then they should not sell tickets to costumers."
147,"Very very bad experience, previously I lost one bag never found and never get a refund. I made a second mistake and book another flight with them, they try to prevent my flight to charge me more money so sorry I will not payback, right now I'm on hold for customer service more than 30 minutes."
148,"I had a booked ticket (H/row/Cairo) for 16/3/2020, as Ihad heard nothing from the airline about problems dueto Covid 19, I travelled from Yorkshire the previous day and flew - arriving at my hotel at 10pm. At 10am, next morning I was told by the receptionist that Cairoairport was closed - from that day until further notice.I went to British Embassy - who were as much use as the proverbial ""chocolate fireguard"". Despite several""repatriation flights"" AND the Embassy having 3 phone numbers for me - I was clearly not consideredsufficiently ""at risk"" to be included. TWO weeks later,after existing on a diet of take away food (all cafes/restaurants closed by the Government) I received a phone call at 8.45am which asked me to look onlineat the repatriation flight which was advertized at10,000LE - single - by Air Cairo. I took a taxi to theoffice (outside Cairo) only to discover that by midday(when I arrived) the fare had increased by 700LE (£35). I had taken exactly 10,000 so could not pay forthe ticket. I then went to a bank and asked them totransfer 10,700LE to Air Cairo - this they did and saidAir Cairo were charging an extra 70LE to RECEIVEthe transfer. The clerk told me he had  NEVER knowna demand for a payment for the RECEIPT of money.THIS was the ""repatriation"" flight arranged by theBritish Embassy!!I have since learned that Air Cairo is an offshoot ofEgyptair!I think you could truthfully say the British Embassy and Egyptair are ""sisters under the skin"".I am 80 years of age, lame from birth and was travelling alone."
149,"WORST FLIGHT EVERRRR!! My wife and I travel regularly and we have never been treated with such disrespect and discrimination as we did during this flight. STAY AWAY FROM TRAVELING WITH EGYPTAIR, IT'S THE WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!!!!!"
150,"Cancelled my booking without telling me. I randomly found out by looking at the egyptair website to see if i could book another bag. They dont respond to emails, their german numbers dont work. My mum phoned their cairo number and they basically said i could only reschedule one time or i would have to pay for another flight. They also said they couldnt confirm whether the rescheduled flight would also be cancelled. So THEY cancel the flight and if THEY cancel again I will pay for nothing. Seems like its in their interest to cancel again..."
151,"I booked to fly to Egypt with Egyptair and was forced to cancel my flight on 25 March due to COVID-19. It has now been over 10 weeks and Egyptair refuse to refund me. According to my travel agent, the airline has decided to with hold all refunds of customers until they are 'back up and running.'This is completely illegal and a gross breach of CAA regulation. I am having to take the airline to court in order to get the refund. THIS IS TOALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Do not book with this thieving criminal airline."
152,Very satisfied and they helped good with my problem. I wanted to book a ticket. After that the website blocked when i wanted to pay. The money was from my bankaccount but i did not fly with this flight. After 1 call he gived me the emailadress. So i send the email with the story and the same day they transfer my money back.Before i travelled a lot with Egyptair. Always had good flights. On time and the service while flying is always good.
153,"I booked my cousin with Egypt airlines from Johannesburg to Frankfurt and honestly speaking am just irritated by them ,I will never use them again,she lost her bag and this was on the 2nd of March ,today it's the 14th of March no one has given us any information about the lost bag and also no one ever picks up the calls ,being calling everyday and no one picks the calls ,very terrible honestly"
154,"Great check in ,good entertainment, decent food and good staff"
155,"Worst customer service, they cancelled my booking from Nairobi to Cairo. Hours before my scheduled flight, I received an e-mail stating that my booking was confirmed but needed to check-in in the airport, once I tried to check-in the airport I was informed that my booking was cancelled and can not board the plane. All Information they gave me, is to go to Egyptair’s website and contact them, the website  has 100’s of numbers that do not answer. After 5 hour of trying different phone numbers, the number that worked was the UAE number. Worst customer service if something goes wrong with your flight, do not recommend this airline."
156,"I purchased my husband's flight with my debit card through egyptair only to find out later when reading their policy that "" the card holder must be one of the travelers in each of the online booking considering that if the customer failed to present the card used for purchasing the ticket(s) during check-in time, EgyptAir has the right to deny passenger boarding""I am livid! Why would I need to flight all the way across the world to show that I am the one who made a ticket purchase with my card for my husband. My husband is migrating from Accra to the United States where I am. This is horrible EgyptAir!!!!!! I was feeling hopeful about using your airline, but all that hope is now gone...Let me guess that I will have to pay to cancel the flight? I will also have to wait 5-7 business days for my money to be refunded causing my husband to be further delayed coming where I am AFTER waiting 2 year to finally get through the immigration process smh.... I am Over it!!!! Highly dissatisfied with this airline.........."
157,"Egyptair stole my money.I made a seat reservation for my mom on her flight and paid by my credit card. The money was taken from my account, but on the day of the flight my mom was told that there is no seat reserved for her and they gave her a random seat.I contacted them many times and submitted a refund request. They admitted the case and responded ""mail has been forwarded to the concerned financial department in order to refund the deducted amount"". And then they stopped responding to me emails anymore."
158,"Worst airlines. Worst Customer services. Worst migration services ever in Cairo. I had all my Legal Documents and a Visa to Amsterdam. They told me the visa is about to expire and asked me if I havea ticket to USA because my final destination was in USA after staying some days in Amsterdam. I told them if i have access to my phone and the internet, i can show you. It is in my emails and if not i can call my son or family to send me the air ticket to USA but they said no. I understood afterwards they need bribes. I didn't not get it at that time. They locked me and deported me to Asmara. What a sad story! I was shocked and ""the EgyptAir customer services is the worst service"" said my Son when he tried to contact the airlines when they locked me and lost contact. I was wrong i should have booked in Ethiopian airlines from the very bigging. After 4 days i arrived in USA."
159,"Worst airline ever. I am someone who travels 1-2 times/year and been doing so for several years. I had traveled with so many airlines; domestic and international. my experience with Egypt air was the worst by far. they are unprofessional, rude, unhelpful. their airplanes are dirty, saturated with cigarettes smell, their food is really terrible."
160,"Very poor quality of service, staff were very rude and unprofessional in the airport, we booked a flight from Dubai to Casablanca by Cairo for an hour, the staff on the plane with a very F** attitude and the problem they left our luggage in Cairo. I cancelled the future ticket even its a non refundable, absolutely I will book with another flight company."
161,"Egyptair Company,  Me and my wife from Erbil wanted to go to Toronto via Egypt.  We got the tickets and didn't have any problems until we came to Egypt.  When the plane landed in Egypt, we continued to receive boarding passes from Egypt to Toronto.  Then we were directed to the hotel for transit passengers at the airport.  We were told that the room would be provided by the hotel staff within 1 or 2 hours.  After six hours, they didn't provide us with a place to rest.  When we turned to them to ask why they didn't provide us with a place, we were told that the Canadian Embassy did not allow us to continue our trip to Canada.  We were not allowed to fly from Egypt to Toronto.  However, we have provided round-trip tickets, Canadian visa and passport, invitation letter from school, invoice, accommodation.  When we asked them to give us any documents stating that the Canadian Embassy did not want us to go to Canada, they said that they could not share any information or documents about it.  After we had the following flight to Erbil for 33 hours, I asked them to provide a room.  But they didn't give us any room and asked us to sit on the chairs and we had to sit on the chairs for 16 hours.  They insulted us and treated us like we did a crime.  The next day we returned to Erbil with a 23:00 flight and immediately went to the EgyptAir office in Erbil.  Upon our request, they could not give any document showing our situation.  In the meantime, we learned that they gave a document to a family like us with a similar problem.  EgyptAir led us to VFS Global, a visa office.  We went to VFS 2 times globally and each time it told us that there isn't any disqualification to go to Canada.  We sent a mail to the Canadian Embassy, ​​they said that you did not see any harm in your flight from Canada.  By the way our luggages claim, they didn't give them back but two days.  We didn't have any clothes.  Claiming our luggages, one of them was broken.  We had to find a place to stay during this time because we used to live in Sulaymaniyah, not Erbil, and we had to buy new clothes.  a day or two later we bought a $ 4700 ticket again and we flew CANADA in transit through Europe on the way or did not experience a problem in CANADA.  I want to use the Egyptian airlines again, we want our money again, but they did not give me"
162,"I have traveled using Egypt air maybe 3 or 4 times. The plane crew has always been very respectful, kind, and understanding. They try to make your experience as comfortable as possible. The issue arrives when you reach the airport in Egypt and you are met with the airport staff. The other times i arrived and had a layover over of 12 hours or more the airline has always accommodated me with a hotel room. When I came this time in January 2020 I had a layover of 14 hours I followed the signs and reached the information desk and asked If i would be getting a room like every other time. I'm not sure what is going on in egypt but because I could not speak their language they were very rude. I was told they are not responsible for providing me anything and if I wanted to sleep I could sleep in the prayer room or on a bench somewhere. I get it hotels are not cheap so If I could not get a free one I'd just pay for one. I asked if I could go pay for one, the person behind the desk said go back down stairs and talk to someone there. I tried to go down stairs the security guard grabbed me and started yelling at me in a language I did not understand. I tried to explain to him that I have a flight in 14 hours so I'm trying to get a hotel room. He took me to a sign that had English writing in it saying ""passengers departing cant go this way."" Again i tried to explain to him that the people behind the desk told me to go this way. He started banging the sign and pointing to it like I didnt get it. Not trying to get into an issue with him i went back to the desk which was about 15 feet from those stairs. I asked the person behind the desk if they could please explain to this gaurd to let me through. I get to the desk now this person has changed i tried to explain to him my situation and this guy told me I dont pay his wages and he cant walk around and hold my hand telling everyone to make my life easier. He also said you westerners always want things handed to you. I have never seen such a disrespectful airport in my life. fI figured I'd just walk around to kill time I used the washroom and the cleaner handed me a paper towel as im leaving the washroom he was screaming at me ""foolos"" or something like that, I soon find out that it means money. He wanted money for handing me a towel lol. I use to recommend Egypt air but after that experience Id never travel with them again I'll pay 1000$ extra for a ticket but not use them and for sure i will never travel through Egypt. I was disgusted with their customer service, and lack of empathy. This is not how you treat customers or guests in your country."
163,"I had a very good experience with Egypt air in regards of the service, and the price.I would recommend it to all my friends and people I know to travel on it. Also I want to to thank the flight attendant Heba Talat who made our trip so comfortable and enjoyful by providing us with all the assistance that we asked for.Honestly it was my first time and definitely not the last one."
164,"Not a single star this airlines deserves .I lost my baggage & from last 1.5 month they nearly blocked all my numbers & emails and not responding to my mails.I don't understand how a operator work like this, harrasing customer is their job.Not a single person from egypt airlines is helping me when i call to customer incase they lift they tell to update within 10 mins but never return back.I have all documented & audio proof , iam going to address it to IATA"
165,Only got one star cause I couldn't give it none. No one answers the phone. Changed flight without notice then checked me in so I couldn't claim compo. Worst ever!
166,"What a horrible airline to fly with, The  seats on their new plane were very small and  very uncomfortable.  I spent almost a week trying to get a seat, You call the company and be on hold for a minimum of an hour and sometimes two.   I would definitely try another airline next time."
167,"Very poor customer service and dishonest disrespectful staff, from agent to supervisors. I called to reschedule my return flight to Egypt. I paid what the rep asked to pay thinking that I am paying the plenty which is fine, but I found out later that the flight class also changed and that was without informing me and without my agreement. I Called again to inform a supervisor with the mistake thinking that I would get help. Spoke with Aymen who introduced himself to me as a supervisor, told him what happened, he simply said that is how it worked, we don’t tell details to the customers to save their time, which by the way would take one sec from the rep to tell me the class changed from X to Y, and he continued saying we tell the customer the total only. First and last time I use this kind of disrespectful, dishonest airlines."
168,"I am giving this Carrier a 1 star because 0 is not possible. The customer service is non existence. I was fooled by their affordable ticket price but believe me, I regret not going for prestigious airlines like Ethiopian. I was given 1 luggage allowance for international flight, which I did not have a problem with but once I bought seats and extra luggage online, there was no confirmation or no email sent to me nor was i able to see these changes reflected in my booking online. All teh customer service telephones worldwide and email they give on the webpage do not work. In addition, the agent tehy work with namely opodo, also is not helping their case. NEVER AGAIN with Egypt air. NEVER!"
169,Very poor service. This is the first time I am experiencing such a bad flight. The staffs were just acting as they are deaf end dumb. Not listening to any requests. 3 times I asked for water but they told 1 min and went and no response. Food was also not at all good. No refreshments offered for first 1.30 hours not even water. Whatever we ask staffs will never provide they will say wait and will just forget.
170,I am still in shock for how bad this company is. From the staff to the plane to the food and to the feeling of safety.... just awful. Whatever you do DO NOT travel with Egyptair.
171,"No Compensation for Missing Suitcase After Four and a Half MonthsIt has been four and a half months since Egyptair lost my suitcase. Since then, I have not received my suitcase or any compensation. This all happened after my husband and I experienced delayed flights and cancelled flights without any prior communication. In my dealings with Egyptair, my communications have been ignored most of the time. The service I have received from Egyptair throughout my entire experience with them has been extremely poor and very disappointing. Egyptair eventually came back to me with an offer to pay only 68% of my missing suitcase claim. Except for the things that Egyptair can never pay me back for (the three days of holiday in Rome that we lost and will never get back, my wedding earrings that I took with me on holiday, the sentimental souvenirs of the places we visited), they are not even willing to pay me the full amount of the missing items in my suitcase. Shame on you Egyptair. I will never ever fly with Egyptair again. I would rather pay double the price anywhere else, as you lose a lot more by flying with Egyptair anyway."
172,"Let me assure you, they will steal your luggage, and you will never get compensated. This is exactly what happened to me. THREE MONTHS AGO. Here are all the emails I have contacted: MyBaggage@egyptairInsurance@egyptairwecare@egyptaircustomer.svs@egyptaircallcenter@egyptaircomplains@civilaviationAll above end with "".com"" but I can't paste entire email as it is again trustpilot policy.non of them, and I mean NON OF THEM, replied a single email.Stay away from these thieves."
173,Well my flight was bad last night from Cairo to luxor on the 4th November you say the cabin crew are good we'll they wasn't very rude and no. Smile a wat so ever I ask for water. She just looked I was sit in 24 a and down below my feet was a big hole and called the crew man he said that's no problem u be OK and all the dust and rubbish in that hole it was bad so u say its a good airline where and u don't get any drink and they talk bad and rude and look at u like u are a ghost
174,Worst company ever.We have been canceled and had to pay for a new ticket. Never been payback even though i ve written to the customer service and even the CEO in France. What a shame to work like that in 2019 !
175,"Booking a trip from US to LOS in December and saw Egyptiar tickets and thought this might be a good flight since the travel time is shorter than Delta or Emrates. Bad Idea...I got charged on my card and no booking itinerary or confirmation was provided; I called customer service and was on the phone for more than three hours. After 12 hrs and me talking to my bank, and blasting them on twitter, a confirmation came in which at this point I was canceling and requesting a refund but not until I talked to a customer the next day, who told me I get my whole refund if I cancel within 24hrs. The 21 days later, being informed that they only going to refund some amount...this is my current battle with them. I guess other peoples review are spot on and accurate...heed these comments, it will save you a whole lot of headaches i promise youMy advice, go with any other airlines except Egyptair, because the small difference in price is not worth it."
176,"We live in NY and spent a long vacation in Egypt touring the sites.  We arrived in Egypt via Lufthansa which included a stop over.  On the way home, we found a star alliance member flight, Egypt Air, which served a non-stop route from Cairo to JFK.  We thought this 12 hour flight would be ideal as we would likely be exhausted from all the sightseeing.  THIS WAS A MISTAKE.The captain smoked cigarettes throughout the whole flight.  The aircraft smelled of smoke and flight attendants acknowledged this, confirmed it was the captain smoking, and proceeded to spray a hideous perfume around the cabin to help mask the stench.  This made it worse!  The entire aircraft was coughing...ironically the no smoking sign stayed illuminated throughout the whole flight.I find it ironic that the entire airline is dry (no beer, wine or liquor), but the captain can fill the air with cigarette smoke for a long haul flight.  Google other reviews as this is not the first time.If you have any choice in airline...opt for a stop over and avoid this airline at all costs."
177,Ok why do you let the pilots smoke on a plane??? Ever heard of safety?
178,I had a great  flying  experience with  Egypt Air recently.  Rode the new Dreamliner I think. Flew from Frankfurt to Cairo. Although seating in Economy was tight it was a pleasant flight.  Good service.  Very helpful staff.  Decent meal.  Happy to have had the opportunity to fly Egypt Air again.
179,"My husband and I had the worst experience ever. We vowed never to use Egyptair again. When we booked the flight, the layover time was 1hr at Cairo. Getting there, our connecting flight had left and we had to go to Entebbe where we had to wait for 7hrs before catching a flight to our final destination- Nairobi. The return flight was the same delay. That inconvenienced our schedule additionally, our suitcases were damaged and the air attendants were soo rude."
180,"Awful, flights are always delayed"
181,I wish I could give no star for this airline because it doesn't deserve it. It was my first and last time to travel with it on the 30th .08.2019.They didn't transfer my luggage to the connecting plane and I am still waiting for stupid 4 days for my luggage to be delivered even after the guy at the lost luggage desk at Munich told me it will only 1 to 2 days for my luggage to be delivered at my address. Let me even not start with the service and food....the worst airline ever. Aarrrgggghhhh.....there is nothing nice to say about this flight.
182,"Some pilots lack the experience of smooth landing and take-off. Most of the stewards are hostesses are very polite and so helpful. However some are not. I recommend you to fly with Egyptair. I flew with Egyptair more than ten times with transit , to and fro, which means more than forty flights. I am very satisfied with the services that are provided by Egyptair."
183,"Do not use this airline. We are currently in Kenya, due to fly to ciaro on the one and only flight they run per day..then to our Connecting flight to Heathrow. Attempted to check in this morning (15 hours before flight) to find that our first journey showed us as 'stand by' with no seat allocation. Meaning they had overbooked the plane and we would not be gaurented entry. We booked this tickets and paid for them 10 months ago. If we are not allowed on this plane then we must wait until 7am sunday morning to get as far as ciaro. Did I mention this flight is also fully booked? On the way here our luggage was lost for three days during the transit. My mother in law flew out two days earlier, arrived at Heathrow to be told by Egypt air they would not be making two stop overs not the one they booked 9 months prior. My mums flight home last week was delayed, so they missed their connection. They then tried to sit her and her 12 year old grandson on opposite sides of the plane after the 8 hour airport wait. Oh and of course, no luggage at Heathrow when they finally made it back after 25 hours of travel.They are a disgusting airline and I would never fly with them again. My wedding is in one week so we have had to pay out 2k for direct flights home as we could be stuck her for 2-3 days before getting a flight otherwise."
184,"I was a bit worried about flying with Egypt Air as I have never tried them before.  Great airline, friendly staff, nice food.  The only problem I had was that the in-flight entertainment system was a little worn out and the supplied earphones weren't great.  But that was find as the price was very competitive."
185,"Flew with Egyptair from Heathrow to Cairo then onto Luxor, after reading bad reviews was concerned but everything ran smoothly, staff were polite, food was good and cases arrived intact. Would fly with them again."
186,Very Poor frequent flyer program . the miles accrual is not clear and doesn't allow miles transfer to other Egypt air members frequent flyer member.
187,MS919 ... i have just entered the airplane to see my seat is wet with urine or vomiting or something ... i asked them to change the seat and i was shocked with their horrible attitude... they don’t make eye contact they don’t talk in a nice way .. and guess what? This wet dirty seat wasn’t my seat.. they have changed the dirty seat with my seat rather than cleaning it ... it smells sooo bad i am about to faint ... i need your help please... we didn’t take off yet but am standing here cause they can’t find a vacant seat for me ... i will stand for the whole flight long and i am diabetic type1 btw so I won’t survive ...Please help !!!!!!I am standing for more than 20 mins now and passengers should never be treated like this and they didn’t show any help they are sooo rude I cannot imagine those people are called hostesses!!!!!
188,"EgyptairVery good serviceChanged reservation quicklyOne word , real awesomeLoved ITAndreas ILIOU"
189,"I am Egyptian and i am sooooo dissapointed with Egypt Air. i have travel with them for years and they will never change. The plane is dirty, they never clean it, interior fabrics are all dirty and ripped and the seats are broken. The staff are very rude and are lazy and not helpful at all. Many times i hear the plans make loud noises my only worries is that they serviced them properly. Once when booking the prices were high i told the manager why are they so high when we are not in peak season and the plane is empty, his reply was you like you travel you don't we take cargo instead. This is their mentally and all branches in Cairo and Europe are rude and not helpful. My advice stay away from Egypt air and Egypt Air port they are also thieves and take your things and sometimes they will blackmail you for your goods. As an Egyptian please boycott them so they can fix their corrupted companies."
190,If the complain about this airline is this bad. What is the Aviation Authority doing about it?
191,"Felight attendent heba on flight number MSR902 ( date: 21 april 2019) is extreemly rude to everyone. I habe never seen something like that before. She was literally pushing people arround. She pushed ome guy down to his seat!!I asked her polity to tell those in front of me to switch their phones off since they were talking on their phones while the airplane was taking off ( the pilot mentioned earlier that we must do that) she got really mad at me and said its something they take care of and thats not the right time to do .... then she told the guy in arabic, the women sitting behind is complaining about you using your phone!"
192,"highly recommended, very warm crew and great timings with reasonable prices, love it"
193,"I have used more than 10 airways in my life.and by far,egypt air is the worst expirance i ever had.i was traveling to addis ababa from guangzhou.we had 17 hours transit.and we were told the airline will provide good hotel service and food and beverage at city of cairo by transit visa.but when we arrive,they told us they cant let us out to the city and gave us room in the hotel.they put 3 people that dont know each other in one bed room which only have two beds.the room was so old and the smell of the toilet was very very aweful.on top of that,they food they gave us was the left over dishes from the plane and they didnt even have anything to drink.the airport has no wifi.so we couldnt use internet the whole time we were in egypt.the stuff was very rude and kind of racist.over all,the whole expirance had me feeling like i was in prison to be honest.i wish it was posibble to upload photos  and videos here so you could realy see  what i am talking about.if ever tought about trying egypt air,i gurantee it is going to be your worst expirance ever.so please avoid egypt air."
194,"we recently travelled from heathrow to luxor via cairo.Although I cant fault the planes and the attendants,the baggage control left alot to be desired.On the outbound flight my hard suitcase arrived with a split on 2 and a half sides,which appeared to be caused by either somebody standing on it or considerable weight placed onto of it,and my wife's case had slight damage to it.On the return journey my wife's case arrived with the corner broke off and 2 wheels missing"
195,"What a disastrous airline!!! Flight was delayed, Flight attendants were rude, no inflight entertainment, we waited several hours at the airport before being put in a hotel, hotel room was rubbish, dinner was rubbish, you have to ask for blanket inside the plane because they are not placed on seats and flight attendant told me “it’s finished” rudely when I politely asked. Plane was terrifyingly shaky during the flight. I was so scared. I could go on and on... it was my first experience with Egypt air and definitely will be my last."
196,"The whole experience was extremely awful. Got left with no explanation in an empty part of cairo airport where the staff kept my passport. I attempted to ask egyptair for assistance with this and their staff were incredibly rude and would not listen to a word I was saying. I attempted to ask them if the mistake that left me stuck there (a single mid 20's female) could have led to my bags being lost but they again refused to speak to me at all saying none of it was their problem. At my destination my bag was missing and since then the airline have completely refused to speak to me. I have had no response to emails, phone calls have been a loop of voice messages and tweets have been ignored. I did receive a response on facebook which was clearly a copy and paste version of their website telling me to check the online tracker which was created at the airport despite the fact I had messaged to notify them all details in the tracker were wrong. I honestly would have nothing to do with this airline again, you could not pay me to travel with them. And of course my luggage is still currently in the great abyss."
197,"They misplaced our luggage for 1 full week, we had to go to the airport grab them (ie: they could not deliver them to us!) and we got 100 USD compensation for the disturbance of 1 week without any belongings while on holidays."
198,"It’s very good airlines, they don’t accept delays, so you need to be there, they move on the time sharply, for example, if the flight at 5:35 it will move at that time if the airplane at not  Egyptian Airport, the food is acceptable compared with any airlines"
199,"I am writing these reviews from flight itself, waiting here from last 1hr 50 mins in side the plane waiting for flight to take off, the innocent excuse that flight attendant gave is “because SOME luggage is missing” , however it is clear that it is a technical issue, the question is?Is the plan condition is so detoriated Is there is no regular checks from the Aviation Ministry on the Aircrafts routine service."
200,"I had my luggage damaged and cannot be fuctional anymore! Plus I had my lock broken and items missing from my suitcase! This is very unacceptable as I do not feel safe flying with an airline which could rob me. I highly do not recommend flying with them as it is very unsafe, unreliable, and untrustworthy. Compensation procedure is a nightmare and have no proper office, nor helpline or anyone helpful!"
201,"I travelled via Egypt Air in September  - I must admit it was the worst journey, as air hostesses were rude and abrupt.  The Egypt Air lost my luggage (which was reported at Heathrow Airport on 10.09.2018), and to date they have not provided compensation, and don't bother responding to my emails and calls.  Absolutely rubbish service wouldn't recommend."
202,Egypt air damaged my baggage so bad I could not use it again put in a claim  was a nightmare no proper office been given the run around now for 4 months if this is how they treat business customers they need to up there game will never fly with is airline again poor in flight service terrible airline
203,"I had a very bad experience with this airline while traveling from Athens to Hurghada. Not only the flight from Athens was delayed and I lost the flight to Hurghada meaning that I arrived at my destination with many hours delay, my baggage did not arrive with me. As I was set to a cruise on the Red Sea I could only retrieve it upon my return to land. Of course, I requested Egyptair to reimburse my expenses. I had to purchase everything needed for my week on the cruise ship. After requesting the invoices, they never replied. I am trying to communicate with them by email but it is shown as blocked address. Did they block my email address? I registered a claim on their website... nothing. As this was not enough, the return flight was also delayed from Hurghada to Athens and eventually arrived at my destination with hours delay. Disastrous.. but at least they should reimburse me for the expenses I had."
204,Mumbai to Egypt flight is not good. If you are vegetarian don't travel by this airline or carry your own food.
205,"RightI book 2 weeks return flight from London to Cairo..paid 638 £They say they issue an elecronic ticket, that is a false. they issue a list with no bar code so you need when you get to the airport to print a ticket..The return flight from Cairo was schedule for 1650, two hours prior i am on their desks and one sending me to another claim is not me, or i finish...A guy asking me for money so i get first on a quegue...Finaly i give my passport and they say you are on waiting list !!!!I ask what you talking about and the guy makes a call from his mobile, later said is ok, and claims that the agent fron London put me on waiting..I show him my itenerary and he said i know.....I told him i have no agent, i psid fully and i got the ticket from their website....Going on the displays it shows delayed 1725...Arround 1800 I am sitting on the plane and finaly we took off 1930....The airhostage most of the time careless, droping things on the floor and running pushing themselves against you on the isle chair.When we arrive i took a blanket in my hand and on of them took it said  not allowed. Fair enough. My worst experience with airline ever."
206,"I fly at least 3 times per year with them, as I live in Egypt. The luggage allowance is amazing 2 x 23 kg and it's never a problem when it's 2 kgs more. Plus the trolley and handbag.The food is not so nice, but sometimes surprising good. I like to fly with them!"
207,Beware !   Egypt air bad choice.
208,"AM I REALLY A Dear Valued Customer, that is what they say. How can they continue to address us like that after about 100 emails. Our baggage was damaged attempted theft. Three of the 4 locks were forced. Egypt Air eventually admitted this and agreed to pay compensation but since we flew into Barcelona and dont have a Spanish bank account they say it is impossible. Now waiting over a year for compensation"
209,Worst airlines ever .The laziness and careless culture which has been implemented in those guys due to  100 years of using shisha on daily bases  has made them lazy . Careless .Able to create fake stories and tell lies .I appologize from the few good people over there.  But above is my personal openion after deali g with soo many companies and authorities including airport and egyptair .
210,"The worst airlines you can fly on. Price, integrity and service wise. Not recommended at all ! I wish there was an option for zero stars"
211,"I had a very bad experience with your airport.My flight was in the last Friday 16/3/2018,from Rome to Cairo my flight number is MS794 at 17:25 pm.I had 3  bags and the Egypt Air company employee make a trouble with me and didn't let me carry the third handbag with me on the plane and he insisted to take it in the check in as a third bag also he made me pay 100 euro extra fees for this extra bag.but when I arrived to Cairo I didn't receive the third bag and I did a report in Egypt Air company & all what they did was emailing the Fiumocino airport and told me that the bag was still there in Rome and didn't come with the flight.I am so upset and disappointed with the bad service and behavior of the employees of the company they are not cooperative or caring about my problem ."
212,"If you book EgyptAir (MS), some weeks before your flight MS send you an email inviting you to upgrade for ""up to 75% off"". The link in the email takes you to their partner - OptionTown.OptionTown 'goes to town' extolling the many benefits that will accrue if you upgrade. One of these is ""additional frequent flyer miles"" but this is false advertising. MS do NOT increase your miles in line with your increased fare.I pointed this out to EgyptAir who replied that it is their policy and they disown OptionTown misrepresenting them.It's worth noting that you never get 75% discount off the Business fare (one way). When you take into account the base fare already paid, then adding the additional amount for the upgrade, the discount works out at more like 40%.Since most Frequent Traveller programs have moved from crediting miles flown to *revenue earned*, it is unacceptable for an airline like MS (who do credit based on revenue) to apply miles based on the original discounted economy fare paid.Absolutely cheap move by EgyptAir showing they fundamentally do not understand how reward systems work.. They don't work when they fail to recognise that they earned higher revenue.I can only assume that the Marketing or Loyalty department of MS is staffed with unqualified people.If you add in that their Cairo frequent flyer lounge which has  uncomfortable seats, snacks nobody wants to eat, and a refusal to offer alcohol for their non-Islamic guests (neither on the flight), travel in any class on MS has to be a necessity. The competition (Gulf airlines) or Ethiopian Airlines offering lower fares and far better in-flight catering and alcohol, it's a wonder that people do fly with them..."
213,Actually I tried other airlines like Swiss air and ethad but in comparison Egyptair is better because I always need 2 bags with me and it cost me a lot in any other airlines but egyptair allows for 2 bags 23kg as standard for international flights with a good price compared to other companies plus it's arrival and departure time is good specially for Europe trips also the landing and takeoff is very good and the food and crew are ok I hadn't any problems with them. They only have to have other cheaper options to compete better with other cheaper airlines and change their meals from time to time and be more accurate in takeoff times.
214,"Lies and  bad excuses form the office in Copenhagen when you have to have money back from them. They try to procrastinate and hope you've forgotten all about the money.Be aware that you don't get any compensation if your flight is delayed several hours and consequently you can't reach your connecting flight and therefore you have to pay for a new ticket.However, you get a juice or a soft drink - great!Never ever Egyptair"
215,"I recently flew Johannesburg-Cairo-Casablanca, without having made a request for a vegetarian meal.  On the 8-hour overnight JNB-Cairo flight, the crew upon realizing my predicament of not having ordered a special meal, got me a vegetarian meal from the first class.  I was also asked to contact Egypt Air Connection desk in Cairo and ask them to get a Veg Meal for the Cairo-Casablanca flight.  I did so and within 3 hours, on the flight I had the veg meal!  This is an unbelievable level of service.  Go Egypt Air!"
216,Great company to fly with polite staff and friendly. Plenty of room on the flight and entertainment. Only problem I have is that egyptair needs to lower there price from London Heathrow or Gatwick to sharm el sheikh for the British people to be able to keep using the company to sharm. Please lower your prices.
217,"I booked a going and back ticket with Travelgenio. The going ticket is on Aegean Air and back ticket on Egypt Air. I had a spelling mistake in my last name, just missed one letter. So I contacted Travelgenio, Aegean Air and Egypt Air with emails to correct the problem. Egypt air responded to me in the same day, and corrected the name in ONE DAY. Travelgenio and Aegean air contacted me after 2-3 weeks with ""please contact our customer service "" and ""please contact your travel agency"". I am calling Travelgenio customer service every couple of days with just the answer ""Aegean Air haven't responded to us yet"". Today I got the same answer + ""we recommend, that you cancel the flight and book another one, because we haven't get any answer. And when we later get an answer, it will be negative answer. And this will cost you 90 Euro "". So I have given a bad review for Aegean air and Travelgenio, so Egypt air deserves 5 star for their fast and positive solving for the problem."
218,"I ended up with a cancelled flight, facing 18 hours in Sharm El-Sheikh Airport awaiting the next available flight. My travel agents failed to inform me of the cancellation, even though they had been told this by Egyptair the day before. Egyptair pulled out all the stops and got me back to London the same day, even placing me on a British Airways flight at their own expense. I am extremely impressed with this - I am not sure any other airline would have done the same. I could not recommend them (and in particular the Egyptair staff at Sharm El-Sheikh Airport who were on duty on Monday 18th May 2015) highly enough."
